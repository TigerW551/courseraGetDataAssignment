=========================

The file run_analysis.R is R script file to create a tidy data set based on the data download from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

To run this script file, one should set the current working directory to the root directory of the unzipped files.
Then simply run source("run_analysis.R") in R.

The script will generate a tidy data file named newDataSet.txt under the same directory, i.e. the current working directory.

This script results from the assignment of the Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data.
